# Autonomous-Buggy-Project
An autonomous Arduino buggy that detects obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo. It controls two DC motors to move forward, turn left/right, or turn around based on obstacle distance readings.

Components Used:

Arduino Uno
2 DC motors with motor driver
Servo motor for sensor scanning
Ultrasonic sensor
H-bridge motor
Mini breadboard
Chassis, wheels, and battery pack

Features:

Moves forward automatically
Detects obstacles in front, left, and right
Chooses optimal path to avoid obstacles
